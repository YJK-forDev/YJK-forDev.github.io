excerpt: 'Large-scale 3D point clouds are often used as training data for 3D
semantic segmentation, but the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process challenges the acquisition of sufficient labeled data.
Meanwhile, there has been limited research on introducing novice
annotators to acquire the labeled data by enhancing their annotation performance and user experience. Therefore, in this study,
we explored solutions involving two dimensions: the presence of
AI assistance and the number of classes visualized simultaneously
in model’s segmentation results in HITL. We conducted a user
study with 16 novice annotators who had no prior experience in
3D semantic segmentation, asking them to perform annotation
tasks. The results revealed an interaction effect between the two
dimensions on annotation accuracy and labeling efficiency. We also
found that displaying multiple classes at once reduced the time
taken for annotation. Moreover, visualizing multiple classes at once
or the absence of AI assistance led to a greater increase in model
accuracy compared to our baselines. The best user experience was
observed when the visualization showed a single class at a time
with AI assistance. Based on these findings, we discuss which environments can enhance novice annotators’ annotation performance
and user experience in 3D semantic segmentation tasks within
HITL contexts.'

RQ: (1) How does the presence of AI assistance affect novice annotators’ annotation performance and user experience with 3D point cloud in HITL? and (2) How does the number of simultaneously visualized classes in the model’s segmentation result affect novice annotators’ annotation performance and user experience with 3D point cloud in HITL?
