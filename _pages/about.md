I'm a first year PhD student in the Department of Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). Before I joined UW-Madison, I graduated from the [EWHA Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do) with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science. There, I worked at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, advised by Professor [Uran Oh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qv4S97EAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked with Professor [David Lindlbauer](https://www.davidlindlbauer.com/) and [Yukang Yan](https://rochester-bear-lab.github.io/yukang) when I visited at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with the Korean National AI Talent Scholarhip.

In my research journey, **I aim to develop an environment where humans can co-exist with AI-enabled robots**. In other words, I want to make robots more desirable one to humans.
To do so, I focus on (1) <u>exploring what humans want from robots to be naturally accepted in complex human environments</u>, (2) <u>developing new AI-based interaction methods, working processes, algorithms, interfaces</u>, etc., and (3) <u>building robust large language models and vision-language models which aligns with human needs</u>.
